Christian de Duve, the chairman of the Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry at
the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, had been studying the mechanism
of action of a pancreatic hormone insulin in liver cells. By 1949, he and his
team had focused on the enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase, which is the first
crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism and the target of insulin. They already
suspected that this enzyme played a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. 

# The discovery of the Lysosome and of the Louvain algorithm originated in the
same city.
