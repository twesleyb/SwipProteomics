Boxplots of module abundance for the __37__ modules with a significant difference
between WT and MUT groups (P-adjust < 0.05). 
Module abundance was summarized as the sum of its protein constituents for each fraction. 
For plotting, module abundance  was adjusted for difference in fraction. 

#### Example Plot:

#### Plot Attributes:
| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| _X-Axis_   | WT or MUT genotype. |
| _Y-Axis_   | Log2(Adjusted Module Intensity) | 
| _Point Shape_   | Circles and triangles indicate animal genotype, WT and MUT, respectively. |
| _Color_   | The fill of the MUT box indicates its module module membership. |

#### Statistical Significance:
| Symbol | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| . | FDR < 0.1   |
| * | FDR < 0.05  |
| **| FDR < 0.005 |
|***| FDR < 0.0005|
