Mutation of the WASH complex subunit, SWIP, is implicated in human intellectual
disability, but the cellular etiology of this association is unknown. We
identify the neuronal WASH complex proteome, revealing a network of endosomal
proteins. To uncover how dysfunction of endosomal SWIP leads to disease, we
generate a mouse model of the human WASHC4\textsuperscript{c.3056C>G} mutation. 
Quantitative spatial proteomics analysis of SWIP\textsuperscript{P1019R} mouse brain reveals that this mutation destabilizes the WASH complex and uncovers significant  perturbations in both endosomal and lysosomal pathways. 
Cellular and histological analyses confirm that SWIP\textsuperscript{P1019R} results in  endo-lysosomal disruption and uncover indicators of
neurodegeneration. We find that SWIP\textsuperscript{P1019R} not only impacts
cognition, but also causes significant progressive motor deficits in mice.
Remarkably, a retrospective analysis of SWIPP1019R patients confirms motor
deficits in humans. Combined, these findings support the model that WASH complex
destabilization, resulting from SWIP\textsuperscript{P1019R}, drives cognitive
and motor impairments via endo-lysosomal dysfunction in the brain.
