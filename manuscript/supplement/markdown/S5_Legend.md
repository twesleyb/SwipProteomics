Plots of protein abundance adjusted for fraction differences for __686__
proteins with an overall significant difference between WT and MUT groups (FDR < 0.05).

#### Example Plot:

#### Plot Attributes:
| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| _x-axis_   | WT and MUT (homozygous SWIP P1019R) groups. |
| _y-axis_   | Log2(Adjusted Protein Intensity) |
| _point shape_   | Circles and triangles indicate animal genotype, WT and MUT, respectively. |

#### Statistical Significance:
| Symbol | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| . | FDR < 0.1   |
| * | FDR < 0.05  |
| **| FDR < 0.005 |
|***| FDR < 0.0005|
