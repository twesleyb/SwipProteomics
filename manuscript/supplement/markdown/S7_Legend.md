Plots of protein abundance for all proteins in a module. 
The __37__ modules that exhibited a module-level difference between WT and MUT groups are shown (P-adjust<0.05).
To plot all proteins from a module together, the intensity of each protein was normalized to its maximum.

#### Example Plot:

#### Plot Attributes:
| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| _X-Axis_   | Centrifugal force (xg) used to obtain the cooresponding subcellular fraction.|
| _Y-Axis_   | Normalized Protein Intensity - protein intensity ratio to maximum |
| _Point Shape_   | Circles and triangles indicate animal genotype, WT and MUT, respectively. |
| _Color_   | Lines connecting points are colored with their module's color. |
