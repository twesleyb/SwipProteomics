# Supplementary tables/

* Table S1 - WASH iBioID results and PPIs among iBioID proteins.

* Table S2 - SWIP TMT Protein level statistical results for both intra-fraction 
             comparisons and WT v MUT (adjusted for fraction) comparison.

* Table S3 - SWIP TMT Module level statistical results. Includes a table describing 
             the final partition of the protein covariation graph.

* File S4 - Plots of the 85 proteins with a significant intrafraction difference
            between WT and MUT mice (FDR < 0.1). 

* File S5 - Plots of the 686 proteins with a signficant difference between WT and
            MUT groups adjusted for baseline differences in fraction (FDR < 0.05).
