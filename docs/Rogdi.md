# SPECIFIC AIMS
Loss-of-function mutations in ROGDI are causally linked to Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome (KTS), 
an autosomal-recessive epilepsy disorder characterized by spontaneous seizures, mild to severe 
intellectual impairment, and amelogenesis imperfecta, a loss of the tooth enamel (OMIM #614574)1-5. 

As the function of Rogdi is not known, how the loss of Rogdi results in epilepsy is unclear. 
We recently performed a proteomics-based study to resolve the in vivo molecular composition of the 
inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD) in which we identified Rogdi at this site6. 
Moreover, 21% of the iPSD proteome was found to be genetically implicated in autism 
and/or epilepsy disorders in humans. These data suggest that iPSD dysfunction may be 
a common epileptogenic mechanism, and more specifically, that the loss of Rogdi may 
produce deficits in GABAergic inhibition that drives epilepsy in KTS.

Our identification of Rogdi at the iPSD suggests that it may be important for postsynaptic 
GABAergic neurotransmission. CRISPR-mediated tagging of endogenous Rogdi with HA epitope 
tags has confirmed that Rogdi localizes at the inhibitory synapse. 

Additionally, preliminary co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments have confirmed 
that Rogdi interacts with several critically important inhibitory postsynaptic 
proteins including Collybistin. Together, these data support the hypothesis 
that Rogdi functions postsynaptically. However, additional proteomics 
experiments in our lab have also identified Rogdi presynaptically. 
Preliminary bioinformatic analysis and co-IP experiments support this idea by 
demonstrating that Rogdi associates with the presynaptic vesicular machinery and may 
be a component of a known protein complex, the regulator of ATPase of vacuoles 
and endosomes (RAVE) complex. The RAVE complex modulates the function of V-ATPases7,8, a 
proton pumping complex that acidifies the lumen of intracellular organelles. 
V-ATPases function presynaptically in the loading of synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters9, 
but may also function postsynaptically in receptor trafficking10-15 and endo/exocytosis16,17. 
In summary, Rogdi is a novel synaptic protein whose loss in humans is strongly linked to epilepsy, 
yet it remains unclear whether and how Rogdi functions in synaptic inhibition. 

These preliminary data direct my main hypotheses: (1) Rogdi localizes at inhibitory synapses 
where it may function pre- and/or postsynaptically as a component of the RAVE complex and 
(2) loss of Rogdi causes deficits in synaptic inhibition and is sufficient to cause 
epilepsy in mice. I will test these hypotheses in the following aims: 

# SIGNIFICANCE
Deficits in synaptic inhibition are strongly implicated in human epilepsies 
as mutations in GABA receptor genes are associated with numerous human epilepsy 
disorders and pharmacological blockade of inhibition invariably results in seizures 
or epilepsy19. However, the molecular mechanisms which govern synaptic inhibition 
in health and disease are not well understood. Thus, the proposed work is highly 
significant as it will address fundamental questions regarding the poorly 
understood mechanisms regulating synaptic inhibition, and it will shed light 
on how inhibitory synapse dysfunction may lead to a human epilepsy disorder.

Cortical inhibitory synapses form predominately on the dendritic shaft or soma20. 
This has occluded the biochemical purification of inhibitory synapses. 
Consequently, there was limited knowledge regarding the molecular composition 
of the inhibitory synapse as well as the mechanisms by which disruption of inhibition 
drives brain pathologies. The iPSD proteome6 provides a prospectus for a deeper 
understanding of synaptic physiology that was previously confined to 
the excitatory PSD. Furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for 
interrogating the links between epilepsy and novel inhibitory synapse proteins.

Rogdi, a protein strongly associated with human epilepsy, was one of 
the novel proteins we discovered at the inhibitory postsynapse. Preliminary data discussed 
below direct the hypothesis that Rogdi is the mammalian ortholog of a yeast 
protein of known function, Rav2. 

In yeast, Rav2 functions as part of a three-protein complex, the regulator of 
ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes or RAVE complex which regulates the reversible 
assembly of the V-ATPase and thereby modulates its function. Although V-ATPase 
function and components of the RAVE complex have been established to be 
conserved in mammalian cells, a Rav2 homolog has not been identified. 

I propose that Rogdi is the final missing piece of this tripartite complex 
and aim to test the conservation of the RAVE complex in mammalian neurons. 
Thus, the successful completion of this proposed work will represent a 
fundamental step towards demonstrating the function of Rogdi, a synaptic 
epilepsy candidate protein of unknown function, and the function of the 
RAVE complex, a poorly understood protein complex in mammalian cells. 

# INNOVATION
Conceptual Innovation. While the excitatory postsynapse has been a major focus of molecular 
neuroscience for the last three decades, the proposed work to study a 
novel protein of the inhibitory synapse is conceptually innovative and 
is expected to shed light on mechanisms of synaptic inhibition
and potential disease etiology.  

The realization that the iPSD is more complex than previously appreciated 
and is a locus of disease burden emphasizes the fundamental importance of an 
understanding of synaptic inhibition. Genomic studies are rapidly accumulating 
evidence implicating various genes in epilepsy disorders21,22. 
Although the field of epilepsy has focused on the role of GABAergic deficits in the
pathogenesis of epilepsy, little beyond the role of GABA receptors and ion 
channels in producing these deficits is known. To begin to address these questions, 
I will utilize a new conditional Rogdi KO mouse in combination with a conceptually 
innovative optogenetics approach to dissect the potential role of Rogdi 
inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic function.

# APPROACH

In this application, I will focus on Rogdi, a protein of unknown function whose 
gene is strongly linked to a human epilepsy disorder, Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome. 
In situ hybridization28, mouse brain proteomics29, and single-cell RNA-seq30,31 
indicate that Rogdi is highly expressed in the mouse hippocampus-putatively in 
the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions. This expression pattern is consistent with the 
potential role of Rogdi in regulating hippocampal excitability and may be pertinent 
to the seizures and intellectual impairments observed in KTS individuals. 

Aim 1. Examining molecular links between Rogdi and the inhibitory synapse. 

Rogdi localizes to inhibitory synapses. I hypothesize that (1) Rogdi localizes at 
inhibitory synapses and (2) is a component of the RAVE complex. 
Rogdi was identified in the Collybistin iBioID proteome. 
Subsequently, we have confirmed that Rogdi can complex with 
InSyn1 and Collybistin, key protein components of the iPSD (Fig.1a). 
Our preliminary data demonstrate that endogenous Rogdi localizes at 
inhibitory synapses in vitro (Fig.1b).  In agreement with this, a 
recent study observed punctate, endogenous Rogdi immunofluorescence 
in the dendrites of cultured neurons; a staining pattern indicative 
of a postsynaptic localization32. However, the same authors also found 
that overexpression of GFP-tagged Rogdi colocalized with presynaptic 
markers in axons of mature cultured hippocampal neurons. Thus, it remains 
unclear if Rogdi resides and functions presynaptically, postsynaptically, 
or at both locations. To address this question, I will first investigate the 
localization of endogenous Rogdi using HITI and STED. 

Rogdi is a component of the RAVE complex. 
Evidence also supports the hypothesis that Rogdi is a component of the RAVE complex. 
Querying databases for known protein domains in Rogdi revealed a leucine zipper domain (PF10259) 
that is found in Rogdi proteins across numerous species, including the Rav2 protein in yeast. 
Alignment of Rogdi's recently determined crystal structure33 with the predicted structure of 
yeast Rav2 using Phyre234 suggests a strikingly similar overall domain organization and tertiary 
structure (Fig.2a). In yeast, Rav2 is a component of a three-protein complex, the RAVE complex7,8 
composed of Rav1, Rav2, and Skp1p35. The RAVE complex associates with and coordinates the assembly of 
V-ATPases in the plasma membrane of cellular organelles. Loss of the core RAVE scaffolding protein, Rav1 
or its binding partner Rav2 impairs V-ATPase function in yeast7,35,36. In humans, Rav1 is encoded by the
orthologous DMXL1, DMXL2, and WDR7 genes. AP-MS proteomics studies have identified Rogdi in
complex with Dmxl237 and a V-ATPase subunit38, supporting the existence of a mammalian RAVE 
complex composed of Dmxl1/2, Wdr7, and Rogdi. 

Finally, loss of ROGDI in KTS causes amylogenesis imperfecta 
(AI; loss of tooth enamel) and epilepsy. The V-ATPase a3 subunit is 
expressed in ameloblasts, a cell type that is responsible for the 
formation of the tooth enamel. Loss of the V-ATPase a3 gene results in AI in mice39. 
If Rogdi acts as Rav2 in facilitating the assembly of the V-ATPase complex, 
loss of Rogdi could be expected to compromise V-ATPase function, and this 
may be the underlying mechanism by which AI occurs in KTS. Furthermore, in 
humans de novo mutations in ATP6V1A were identified in patients with
developmental encephalopathy and epilepsy40. Thus, a loss of V-ATPase 
function caused by a loss of ROGDI may underly two hallmark features of KTS-AI and epilepsy.  

Despite the apparent conservation of the RAVE complex function from yeast to humans, 
no homolog of the Rav2 gene has been identified in mammals. The above evidence 
provides preliminary support for my hypothesis that Rogdi represents the mammalian ortholog of Rav2. 

Deficits in GABAergic inhibition cause epilepsy.
 I hypothesize that loss of Rogdi produces deficits in synaptic inhibition and 
 spontaneous seizures. Genetic50-54, pharmacological55, anatomical56-62, and 
 electrophysiological63-65 evidence all demonstrate that the loss of GABAergic 
 inhibition is a critical aspect of the pathology of epilepsy, yet the 
 molecular mechanisms which govern synaptic inhibition in health and 
 disease are still not clear. Our novel Rogdi mouse represents an 
 opportunity to study the pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic inhibition.
