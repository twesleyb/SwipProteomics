Because of ion statistical effects, measurements of intensities are more variable and therefore
less accurate when the mass peaks arise from a smaller population of ions. When you perform
precision quantification, you might want to filter out reporter peaks or spectra that have a
variability that is too high because of ion statistical effects. However, with an Orbitrap
analyzer, the intensity of a signal is not proportional to the number of ions corresponding to
the signal. Instead, the number of ions is proportional to the S/N value of a peak
(number_of_ions = 6  S/N for D30 Orbitraps, and number_of_ions = 4  S/N for D20
Orbitraps).
To filter reporter ion quantification input data that is detected from a number of ions that is
too small, you use the signal-to-noise (S/N) values of the reporter ion peaks instead of their
intensities to provide such a measurement when ions are acquired in the Orbitrap. You can
use the settings of the Reporter Abundance Based On parameter of the Reporter Ions
Quantifier node to select signal-to-noise intensity values. For information on this parameter,
refer to the Help.
