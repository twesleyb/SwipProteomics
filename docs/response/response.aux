Where \texttt  {Mixure} is a blocking factor that accounts for sources of variablity between experiments. Protein-wise deviance statistics were transformed to normality and plotted aganis theoretical normal quantiles using \texttt  {edgeR::gof}. \textbf  {(B)} The normalized protein data were fit with a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) of the form: \texttt  {Abundance} \textasciitilde {}\texttt  {0 + Condition + (1|Mixture)}. Where \texttt  {Mixture} indicates the random effect of \texttt  {Mixture}. The residual deviance and degrees of freedom were extracted from the fitted models, z-score normalized, and plotted as in (A). Proteins with significantly poor fit are indicated as outliers in blue (Holm-adjusted P-value $<$ 0.05).\relax }}{}}
