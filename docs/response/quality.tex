Quality Metric


We aim to cluster the protein-covariation network in order to identify modules
which cohesive protein abundance profiles.

R2(fixef) aka R2c (conditional) -- interpretation: the total variance explained
by fixed effects (Genotype:BioFraction). We wish to maximize this quantity.

PVE(protein) -- the percent of the modules variation explained by protein
variability. An ideal module is a perfect summary of its constituent proteins
and this quantity is 0. We aim to minimize the PVE(protein).

This ratio just becomes:
for k = 1 ... K
q_k = var(fixef) / var(protein)

The overall quality of a partition is the average quality of its modules.
All other things being equal, an increase in K cooresponds to a decrease in
quality. We want to identify the ideal number of clusters.
