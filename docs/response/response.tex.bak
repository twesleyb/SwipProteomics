\section{Procedure}

At the centre of the reviewers' cogent critique of our manuscript 
was the questioned statistical validity of our approach. Succinctly, 
the issue at question is whether or not the R package `edgeR`
is an appropriate tool for statistical inference in mass spectrometry 
experiments.

High level statistical inference in `edgeR` is built on a 
negative binomial (NB) generalized linear model (GLM) framework. 
The data are assumed to be adequately described by a NB distribution 
parameterized by a dispersion parameter, $\phi$. \footnotemark

\footnotetext{ The dispersion parameter can take several forms. 
\textbf{edgeR} supports three types of dispersion models: 'common', 'trended', and
'tagwise'. When using edgeR's robust Quasi-likelihood test methods, only global
(i.e. common or trended) dispersions are appropriate (see ?edgeR::glmQLFit).}

Our previous approach used a customized workflow, \footnotemark design
to accomodate our specific sources of variability in our experimental 
design. We used \textbf{edgeR} to perform statistical testing  
using its flexible GLM framework.

\footnotetext{ The most important step in our normalization approach is 
IRS normalization. IRS normalization scales protein measurements using an 
internal reference standard to normalize protein measurments composed of 
different peptides between diffirent TMT MS runs. Phillip Wilmarth's GitHub 
offers an excellent exploration of IRS normalization.
}

Our decision to use \textbf{edgeR} was motivated by numerous 
conceptual and practical considerations. \textbf{edgeR} is an excellent package,
and should be strongly considered when analyzing RNA-sequencing data. Here we 
only consider its appropriatness for our TMT dataset.
