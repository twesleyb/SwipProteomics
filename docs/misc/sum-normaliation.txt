The second aspect, and more specific to spatial proteomics data, is scaling all
Before building the correlation network, we perform sum normalization to scale 
module-profiles into the same intensity interval by dividing each protein
intensity by the sum of all intensities for that protein.

This transformation of the data assures
cancellation of the effect of the absolute intensities of the quantitative
features along the rows, and focus subsequent analyses on the relative profiles
along the sub-cellular channels.
