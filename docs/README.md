This is the F31 I wrote about Rogdi.
ABSTRACT
The pathophysiology of epilepsy is intimately linked with imbalances of
excitation and inhibition (E/I) in the
brain. Although the loss of GABAergic inhibition is strongly implicated as a
mechanism by which E/I imbalances
arise in human epilepsy disorders, the molecular mechanisms that govern synaptic
inhibition, and thereby
maintain E/I balance, have been largely obscure. Recently, we discovered a novel
inhibitory synaptic protein,
Rogdi, whose gene is strongly linked to a human epilepsy disorder,
Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome. Preliminary
data indicate that Rogdi may function either at the pre- or postsynapse where I
hypothesize that it may regulate
the synaptic vesicle cycle or protein trafficking. I propose to test this
hypothesis and demonstrate Rogdi’s
functional role at inhibitory synapses. Importantly, I will also determine if
the loss of Rogdi is causal for seizures
in mice. The successful completion of the proposed research will generate a new
preclinical mouse model for
studying Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome and can be expected to generate an
understanding of Rogdi’s molecular
function and its contribution towards the etiology of a human epilepsy disorder.
