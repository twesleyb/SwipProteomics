Impact statement:

We present the proximity proteome of the neuronal WASH complex.
This protein parts list contains known WASH interactors and is enriched for endosomal 
proteins, consistent with the strongly conserved role of WASH in endosomal
trafficking. The spatial proteomics analysis of a WASH complex mutant, SWIPP1019R,
demonstrates that the major cellular consequence of loss of 
WASH commplex function in neurons is the dysregulation of endosomal 
and lysosome pathways. These changes are acccompanieed by markers of
neurodegeneration. These endo-lysosomal changes seem reminiscent of other
lysosomal disorders and may be a convergent molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathobiology of neuro-degenerative disorders.

We believe that our combined proteomic approaches provide a robust framework for 
the extending the expansive, yet shallow existing knowledge of gene-disease
associations, which is a dogmatic approach to interogating pathobiological mechanisms.
