## Background
The SWIP P1019R point mutation was identified in humans with intellecutual and
motor impairments. 

## Methods
Using TMT-proteomics we quantify 5,894 proteins across seven mouse brain subcellular
fractions. 

## Results 
We show that this point mutation disrupts expression of the
WASH complex in the brain and results in empaired endosomal trafficking in
neurons. Mice exhibit impaired cognition and motor deficites as well as cellular 
biomarkers of neurodegeneration. 

## Conclusions


## Explore
To explore the data, download or install this repository as an R package.
```
git clone twesleyb/SwipProteomics
```
```R
# Download as an R package.
devtools::install_github('twesleyb/SwipProteomics')

```

## Reproducibility 
Effort was made to make the analysis as reproducible as possible. Reproduce the
R environment used to perform that analysis using [conda]() and [renv]().
