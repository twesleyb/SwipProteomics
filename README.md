# FIXME:
* examine meta organization of modules
* where are the lysosomes?
* add sheet with module membership to module results xlsx.
* update protein boxplots with glm pvalues (select proteins)
* is nework ppi information too big to save?
* module protein plots label is nproteins -- mising outline?
* change these plots to their colors?
