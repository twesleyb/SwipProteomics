# FIXME:
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Save network PPI information.
* module_noa and module_stats are potentially redundant
* column names of module_noa changed and may cause bugs
* adjusted protein boxplots -- some  of 968 are annotated as NS?
* Insure consistent use of BF p-adjust for higher level stats.
* TMT gene map columns were changed  and may cause bugs.
=======
* examine meta organization of modules
* where are the lysosomes?
* add sheet with module membership to module results xlsx.
* is nework ppi information too big to save?
* module protein plots label is nproteins -- mising outline?
* change these plots to their colors?
* clean-up GO and NDD enrichment tables.
